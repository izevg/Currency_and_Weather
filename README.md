# Currency (CB RF) and Weather Widget #

## Description ##
Simple WordPress widget for displaying weather for selected city (with dynamical weather icon) from OpenWeatherMap, and USD-EUR currency from Central Bank of Russia.

## CSS Customization ##
HTML representation of widget has next structure:

```html
-- div#currency-and-weather
 | -- div#weather
 |  | -- img#weather-icon.weather-details
 |  | -- div.weather-details
 |  |  | -- div#weather-temperature.weather-info
 |  |  | -- div#weather-description.weather-info
 | -- div#currency
 |  | -- div#dollar
 |  |  | -- div.currency-name
 |  |  | -- div.currency-value
 |  |  | -- div.currency-dynamic
 |  | -- div#euro
 |  |  | -- div.currency-name
 |  |  | -- div.currency-value
 |  |  | -- div.currency-dynamic
 ```

How you see, all elements are fully customizable.
DON'T edit the plugin CSS file. Write your own styles in custom CSS file (with native WordPress "Custom styles" function, for example).

## TODO ##
 * Add caching time setting
 * Add "Select currencies" ability
 * Translate widget to English (with native text_domain entries)
 * Add more weather info to widget
